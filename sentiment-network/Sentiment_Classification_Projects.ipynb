      "Progress:0.8% Speed(reviews/sec):299.8 #Correct:5 #Tested:9 Testing Accuracy:55.5%you have to understand  when wargames was released in      it created a generation of wannabe computer hackers . the idea that a teenager could do anything of far reaching proportions  let alone deter a world war was novel and thrilling . real computers were beginning to show up in people  s homes  and for the first time  society was becoming interconnected in a way that made the movie  s premise excitingly prescient . granted  a talking computer that balanced it  s free time between chess and global thermonuclear war was a bit far fetched  but the brilliant commentary on nuclear proliferation and the cold war made up for it . i  ve probably even heard of the hackers that this movie was actually based on .  br    br   fast forward   years  and we have a horrible mutant of a thing that i loathe to call a  sequel   called wargames the dead code . i  ll just dig right in . first of all  the plot hinges on a government operated gambling site where folks who win the games automatically become terror suspects . you  re probably very confused right now . the idea is that eventually the terrorist will click on the sub  game within the web site called  the dead code  where they pilot a plane over a city  spraying it with bioweapons . at some point in the game  you have to choose between  sarin gas  and  anthrax   and if you choose  sarin   then you  re automatically confirmed as a bioterrorism weapons expert and your family is taken into custody and interrogated . in the movie  this actually happens . however  since the payment for the game was made from a bank account that was suspicious  it obviously all makes sense .  br    br   second  the avatar of the ai in this straight  to  dvd bomb is an annoying flash animation that keeps repeating the pop  up  ad  esquire sound bite  play with me baby  . because apparently in the future  advanced ai loses interest in intellectual pursuits like chess  and gets into porn .  br    br   third  the motivation for these  hackers  is profit and women  as opposed to pure curiosity as in the original movie . for some reason  recent hacker movies feel the need to portray all young adults as average surfer dude kind of people who are just like everyone else . that may work for your average sitcom  but c  mon  you don  t learn how to take over government computers by doing your hair  playing sports  and shopping at the mall  folks . the one novel thing i noticed was that at some point in the dialogue there is a reference to a matt damon movie  and then later there is the phrase   good hunting  will  . i swear  they named the main character will just for that phrase so they could send a high five to mr . damon . this will kid isn  t bad  but he was certainly wasn  t like any obsessive hacker i  ve ever met . i can  t fully state how annoyed i am that this movie shares the same name as the original  because it has absolutely nothing in common with it except professor falken and joshua  wopr  make a reappearance in this movie  as a limp old man who apparently is dying of boredom  and a dilapidated old tic  tac  toe machine with a higher pitched voice . after some prodding  joshua  the ai  has what appears to be sex with the new ai with the porn voice  a bunch of board games flash on the big screens  and the whole  the only way to win  is not to play  revelation is supposed to be the crowning moment . except that those of us who saw the original  you know  those who would want to see this in the first place have already been there and done that . a recycled ending for a movie made from last month  s compost .  br    br   the new movie was directed by a guy who  s done       and written by guys who do b movies . the original was directed by a guy who  s been keeping himself busy with  heroes   so you see the quality difference there . there was talk of a real remake  but i hope they don  t destroy this classic all over again . i swear  if i have to  i  ll visit every gambling web site until i find the one that  s run by a psychotic government computer . the saving grace is that i was able to stream this on netflix  so at least the only energy i expended watching this disaster was for breathing  clicking  and indigestion .  \n",

project . we discover that the  guy  who ran into annie is falken  not played by the original actor sadly  who faked his own death .  br    br   we also get to see wopr as  what  s going to help  them beat ripley and they kept the same voice used back then . falken  wopr are destroyed too quickly after being hardly used at all  the same explosion should kill will  annie  the russian . it  s also unlikely they  d create a self  contained computer system that has the ability to nuke or drop chemical weapons on the country it operates out of .  br    br   the whole  decontamination  plot  idea are totally unbelievable . those kinds of orders would have to go through the president or joint chiefs of staff . so yet another laughable  unbelievable idea .  br    br   the ip hacks against ripley aren  t done by will  he just contacts one of his friends who suggests  implements the idea . it  s excessively laughable that will would get a login just from increasing ripley  s operating temperature . having joshua as a backdoor into ripley  especially after it had been blown to bits  is an incredible cop  out and screams of a very desperate writer who had no ideas left and wanted to get this movie over and done with .  br    br   there is an awful good where ripley is playing dead code and we see a countdown  saying   minutes  then ripley says  decontamination in   minutes   how crap is that when they can  t even keep up with their own timer  ripley  s attack mission against philadelphia is halted  far too easily in my opinion  and it decides to attack joshua in its internal circuits and reroutes the missile aimed a philly to washington where ripley is stationed . the idea of the nuclear exchange to make ripley realise what she  s doing won  t work  surely she  d already know if she had joshua insider her as he  d already learnt this lesson in the original movie   is yet another nod back to the original movie .  br    br   their cop  out at having ripley repeat joshua  s exact same words form the end of the original movie just goes to show how many original ideas they were unable to come up with .  br    br   if you want to point fingers for bad  stolen ideas the men to blame are randall badat  rob kerchner . this is an awful movie and is best avoided .  \n",

      "Progress:4.4% Speed(reviews/sec):345.3 #Correct:23 #Tested:45 Testing Accuracy:51.1%someone  some day  should do a study of architecture as it figures in horror films of all those explorations of weirdly laid out mansions  searches for secret passageways and crypts  trackings of monsters through air ducts  and so forth . offhand i can recall only a few films in which architecture played a major role throughout    demon seed    cube   the remake of  thirteen ghosts    but it  s at the heart of every story about a spooky house or church or crypt it  s all about the character and the affect of spaces  passages  and walls . so i was looking forward to this thriller where it promised to be central . the idea is this an architect has built   actually  rebuilt   for himself a huge and rambling house his wife has just left him  mainly because of his own self  centeredness  but also  it is intimated  because she can  t get used to the place since he remodeled it . living in unaccustomed solitude  real this time  rather than virtual   he comes to suspect that somebody else   a stranger who had come to the door one evening asking to use the phone and then suddenly disappeared   is living into the house with him only the place is big enough so that he never sees him .  br    br   this is a good start for a melodrama  whose development one would expect to follow some such lines as these after searching the house for the intruder a few times without success  the architect resorts to his blueprints to undertake more systematic searches  trying in various ways to surprise  intercept  or ambush the intruder  maybe by means of some special features he built into the structure . meanwhile the intruder has discovered hiding places and back ways between places that the architect didn  t foresee or doesn  t remember . the movie would turn into a cat  and  mouse game  a hunt  a battle and finally  in trying to trap the intruder  the architect himself would end up trapped in his own creation  in some way he didn  t expect . then he would be forced to think himself out of it   and maybe at the same time out of his own self  imposed isolation   and in a final twist would nail  and maybe even kill  the er .  br    br   nothing like this happens in this movie the house is just a house  the architect is just a guy  and his nemesis is of an unknown character  if he exists at all . here is what does happen in the movie once the intruder is installed in the house   if he is   the architect begins hearing noises  but when he goes to investigate finds nothing . he calls the police  they think he  s slightly nuts he persuades his estranged wife to spend the night  she thinks he  s more nuts . at last  more or less accidentally  he runs into the intruder  doesn  t get a good look  but figures  who else could it be    not a hard question  in a story with  to that point  fewer than three principal characters   whereupon he locks the doors  lowers the grills on the windows  throws away the key  i don  t know why he thought this necessary   and leaves his victim to starve . i missed why this was a given the doors and walls are made of steel  in any event  the architect takes to sleeping in his car . and since the idea of the movie has languished undeveloped and cannot now be developed further  something else must be devised to take its place . and this is it the architect   are you ready    moves into the house of the man who  presumably  moved into his  and lives there in the same way . how is this possible  it is not  but the movie takes this route to try and make it seem so the architect has drawn a picture of the man who came to his door and when he leaves the house he takes the picture with him and while sitting in his car  he throws the picture into the street and two kids pick it up and observe that it looks like martin  their neighbor whereupon the architect asks where his house is and the kids point the way .  br    br   if this sequence seems to verge on the implausible  what ensues plunges right in . the architect takes up residence with martin  s wheelchair  ridden wife  unbeknownst to her so stealthy in his moves and so cunning in his reading of his hostess that he  s able always to leave a room just as she enters or to duck out of sight just as she turns around . throughout this section the movie is clever in one way  making  or leaving it to the viewer to make  the point that his life with this stranger  who doesn  t know he  s there  is in essence the same life he lived with his wife  as a virtual recluse with her as a convenient buffer . but at the same time  his inability to live in the world makes his transformation into raffles the cat  burglar entirely incredible . not to go into the series of twists at the end   including another murder achieved by locking someone in behind another invincible door   this one in front of a landing so flimsy that it collapses under the weight of a wheelchair two nice people who take murder in stride and  before the story started  the unnoticed construction of a tunnel under several houses . . . . to the final  long  anticipated twist  the movie adds another  to make it even more offensive  and then . . . ends .  br    br   here is a story that depends on the development of two things   the idea of the stranger in the house  and the character of the man whose house it is   and fumbles both . the first fumble makes it boring the second made me angry  as it pushed its main character farther and farther along a more and more zigzaggy path  and never offered any explanation for the character who most required one martin the tunnel  builder and sneak  tenant . the story should be redone by someone  some day .  \n",

manifested here in the form of several glaring inconsistencies  yet all told dbd represents the mature spirit we  d love to see more of in the hk mainstream .  br    br   it also marks the heralded return of edison chen  long absent since the initial d debacle of a year ago . chen  s reserved machismo does wonders for the movie  yet would have had it rough without opposite sam lee  whose knack for alternating between physical comedy  crazy  n  the city  no problem   and lunatic menace has culminated in the strongest role we  ve seen from him since made in hong kong .  br    br   together

remains a rare occurrence .  br    br   mostly upon commencing  dbd showcases some mesmerizing imagery  playing gorgeous tricks with light  shadow and perspective . the soundtrack boosts this atmospheric effect  adding to the overall unreal mood the film purveys . much of the resultant combination probably has to do with writer matt chow  previously engaged in likewise gruesome three extremes . dog bite dog retains numerous traits recalled from that horror project  namely rundown urbanscapes and a pervasive air of something eerie lurking round the corner .  br    br   rest assured  though  this isn  t a horror movie  instead following a path trodden before by classic one nite in mongkok  albeit from a miles more perverse angle . replacing daniel wu  s reluctant mainland assassin character we have edison  playing a nameless killing machine hailing from cambodia  s underworld . sent hong kong  way to execute a single target  the nearly silent assassin takes care of business immediately upon arrival  a process chillingly depicted courtesy of the film  s brilliant visuals .  br    br   although weaned from childhood to become a professional killer  edison  s eponymous wild dog still has human weaknesses and leaves a trail  picked up on by a cid team sent to investigate . this assembly features a nice cameo by mob  movie stalwart lam suet  and good support from tv star wayne lai . however  sam lee  s renegade officer wai leads the charge  revealing himself to be a highly disturbed individual but excellent cop nonetheless . we gradually learn wai  s inner  conflict stems from his father  s police corruption background  evoking demons handy in the relentless pursuit that ensues .  br    br   a minor body count transpires  as edison seems to consider taking prisoners a no  no . there  s quite the violence quotient in store  even though gore per se feels toned down in places  and adult language only makes a token appearance . once more  no nudity  leading one to conclude cat iii  s are being handed these days a bit hastily . still  dbd  s a relatively mature theatrical release  and we applaud its arrival .  br    br   in between the fighting  stabbing  hacking and shooting  even a career murderer needs some romance  and just like daniel wu had cecilia cheung in one nite  so does intrepid mr . chen get a sweetheart  done beautifully by new comer pei pei . her unnamed character  lots of anonymity in this one  meets edison  s at a strangely deserted landfill  abused by her father to the point of repulsive madness and yearning for escape . when the killer ditches hk  he agrees to take her with him  and they go on the run together  love blooming en route . while the movie doesn  t linger on lovey  dovey stuff  our hearts go out to pei pei  s tragic character and her endless suffering . she renders the timid but valiant protagonist amazingly well  establishing that there aren  t any good or bad guys here  evinced by the highly sobering finale .  br    br   director cheang soi  s portfolio includes recent suspense thriller home sweet home and love battlefield with eason chan  two numbers likely surpassed in most accounts by dog bite dog  s sinister demeanor . cheang manages to keep dbd flowing throughout  and considering the many parts in play here  stands up to critical standards erected by people like johnny to in his watershed nocturnal epic the mission . a couple of glitches do come about  to wit edison miraculously shrugging off a shot to the chest  but these are highly forgivable .  br    br   marking triumphant returns for two young  talented performers of the kind hong kong needs if we want the city  s movie heyday to come back  dog bite dog doesn  t stand out for story . its forte lies in strong portrayals and style  buoyed along on the strength of thespian muscle and a keen eye for visual and auditory finesse .  br    br   hk has a long  time  honored tradition of

that teens were facing in britain and how these troubled  constantly hitting each note  teen  s problems can relate to the youth of tomorrow . it could have been dubbed the  moulin rouge  of the   s  but it disappeared . it made its very shallow mark on the world  snuck under the radar  and can now be found collecting dust at either the musical section  the comedy section  or the politically obscure section of that seedy video store that doesn  t need chain money to survive . alas  that wasn  t where i found it  but i found it  watched it  tried my hardest to sing along with it  stared into bowie  s eyes  but found myself faded by the end . did it not survive the test of time  is     s london too far removed from our current society  is bowie too creepy  i think  absolute beginners  falls somewhere into each of these questions as the perfect example of cinema that starts out with a bang  but withers to a mere sparkle by the end .  br    br    absolute beginners  opens with a huge number that takes us through the non  gritty streets of london which involve theft nightly  prostitutes on every corner  dance throughout  booze like rivers  and the swankiest ties on nearly every individual . sounds like a place we would all hate to be  right  director julien temple keeps the mood light and flashy throughout most of the songs as we attempt to learn something about a plethora of our main characters . the one we follow most is colin played by eddie o  connell who follows his dreams of being a photographer while shooting his favorite girl  suzette  played by patsy kensit  . these two have chemistry  and while suzette looks like a pre  rehab lohan  to me they worked . there was a huge spark between them  the chemistry was like lava  and i believed that these two could take me down a road i had never traveled . i was ready  but then  something happened . temple takes us out of the nightlife  takes us out of the city we grew up with at the beginning  and completely reverses the roles without any dedication to the first . suzette runs away  colin becomes a pervert  and bowie  well  i am not quite sure what his role is but he sings amazingly well while climbing a mountain  i can tell you that much . temple gives us this flashy city  this opportunity to see those that inhabit it  but leaves us hanging high and dry when it is time to pull the trigger . we learn about colin  mainly  but nobody else . i could probably watch this film again and still be equally confused as to whom is angry at whom  and what importance fashion had to that era . also  were they teens really  they all seemed like they were pushing their late   s  but maybe it was my tv .  br    br   character development thrown right out the door  temple tries to overcompensate by giving us bigger  more lavish songs using even more characters that we know nothing about . one of my favorite songs in the film uses this thought as a prime example . temple uses a split house to show us the lives of colin  s parents  of which i didn  t know it was them until after the film  and a song which screams apathy . great song  too many characters  not enough time  suddenly dragged into another scene of missing coherency  and it just falls apart in your hands . then  if that wasn  t enough  we are rocking our heads to the beat of some great songs  rubbing our noggin  trying to understand where our characters are or are going  and temple throws in hatred  anger  and politics into the final act . while i was hoping that this film would have a dedicated theme  i didn  t think racism would be on the top of the bill . suddenly  friends are missing  people are angry  and there is some random guy running around fighting colin because he lives in poverty and has a friend of a different race  somebody help me out here . it seemed completely rushed and overwhelming  nearly to the point of wanting to turn the film off . to me  the ending of  absolute beginners  was nowhere near the excitement from the opening number . that first part set the pace  and temple could not keep up .  br    br   overall  i must say that temple can direct a music video  but i don  t think he was quite prepared for the feature film . i don  t think this film will ever make it into full  cult  status  and will probably remain unremembered or in the dollar bin for years to come . it is a fun film to watch initially  but when we get to that final part  it just explodes from the inside . i wanted some cutting edge work  but instead what i found was a freaky bowie coupled with characters i cared nothing for . i could see how this film could relate to the youth of the   s  but by the end it just felt forced . i think everyone in this production should have taken a moment and listened to  motivation  by the ever  freaky bowie in this film  it may have helped solidify this feature into better cult status . i am glad that i watched this film once  but that is all that my small brain can take . i loved the way that temple caught me from the beginning  but he couldn  t control his characters  way too many   and the songs didn  t seem to match the final moments of the film . it came out of nowhere  and it was unwelcomed . if this was a film about racism  it needed to be from the beginning .  absolute beginners  was a welcomed adventure  but i don  t think i will be dusting this film off in the future .  br    br   grade  out of   \n",

      "Progress:28.3% Speed(reviews/sec):363.8 #Correct:142 #Tested:284 Testing Accuracy:50.0%what a strangely wonderful  if sometimes slight and bulky  big  budget fantasy this is . takashi miike had already proved  by the time he got to the great yokhai war  that he could dip into other films aside from his supposed niche of the crime  yakuza genre  visitor q and andromedia showed this  the former great the latter lesser  . but here miike  in his first and only co  screen writing credit no less  proves that he can deliver the goods on a post  modern soup of mythical fantasy conventions  and with it boatload of cgi  creature  effects and make  up  and an epic battle that is more like a  festival  than something out of lord of the rings . the comparisons can be made far and wide  to be sure  and the most obvious to jump on would be miyazaki  for the seemingly unique mixture of kids  as  big  heroes  power  hungry sorcerers looking for the energy of the earth as the main source  machinery as the greatest evil  and many bizarrely defined  flamboyantly designed creatures  or yokai of the title  . but there can also be comparisons made to star wars  especially to the gungan battle in tpm  and to the whole power  play between good and evil with similar forces . or to anime like samurai  . or  of course  to henson  s films . and through all of these comparisons  and even through the flaws or over  reaching moments  it  s miike all the way with the sensibilities of effects and characters .  br    br   here  ryunosuke kamiki plays tadashi  the prototypical kid who starts out sort of gullible and sensitive to things in the world  but will become the hero in a world going into darkness . the darkness is from an evil sorcerer  who gets his energy from all of the rage and wretched vibes in the human world  and who is also starting to put to death the spirits and other creatures  the yokhai  into a fire that sends them into gigantic robots that have only one mission  to destroy and kill anything in their paths . tadashi gets as pumped up to fight sato the sorcerer as the yokai once sato  s main minion and cohort  agi  kill bill  s chiaki kuriyama  another great villainies  steals tadashi  s little furry companion  a sunekosuri . soon  things come to a head  in a climax that brings to mind many other fantasy films and stories  but can only be contained  up to a point  by miike and his crew . i would probably recommend the great yokai war for kids  but in the forward note that it  s not some watered down fantasy in american circles . this has creatures galore  including a one  eyed umbrella stand  and a walking  talking wall  not to mention a turtle  a fire serpent  and a woman who became cursed by sato . so the variety is on high on that end  and one might almost feel like the creatures and effects  which grows to unfathomable heights when the  festival  hits with the yokai reaching hundreds of miles in scope . but there  s also a sense of fantasy being strong in both the light and the dark  and sunekosuri becomes perhaps the greatest emotional tool at miike  s disposal  and not just because it  s cuteness squared   where else to get an audience riled up than over a little furry ball of fury  who ends up in a tragic battle with tadashi in robot form   br    br   yet through all of this  the sense of anarchy that can be found in the brightest spots of miike  s career is here as well  which distinguishes it from its animated  muppet and sci  fi counterparts . there  s the bizarre humor as usual  including a song dedicated to akuzi beans at a crucial moment in the climax  and more than a few flights of fancy with the creatures and fight scenes  i loved  for example  the guy with the big blue head who has to make it smaller  or the anxious turtle  yokai  . the biggest danger with miike  s access to bigger special effects and computer wizardry  which he flirts with  is overkill on this end . he  s got everything down  i  m sure  with storyboards  and he creates some memorable impressions with some compositions  one of them is when all is said and done  and tadashi and the  other  human character are in the middle of the tokyo rubble in an overhead shot   but the cgi is sometimes a little unconvincing with the robots  and the interplay skirts on being too flamboyant  and some visuals  like the overlay of the yokai spreading the word about the big festival on the map  just seem weak and pat . i almost wondered if miike might dip into  bad  spy kids territory  quite frankly .  br    br   but this liability aside  the great yokai war provides more than a share of excitement  goofy thrills  and innocent melodrama that came with many of the best childhood fantasies . it owes a lot to cinema  as well as traditional japanese folklore  but the screws are always turning even in its most ludicrous and veeringly confusing beats . it  s not the filmmaker at his very best  but working in experimentation in a commercial medium ends up working to his advantage . it  s got a neat little message  and lots of cool adventure .  .      \n",

poor one like the dreadful remake of homeward bound the incredible journey . or in the case of cats  dogs  you have a great idea for a film not living up to its potential . when i heard about paulie  the premise of a wisecracking parrot didn  t exactly fill me with confidence . but i found the film a pleasant surprise . and it manages to sneak its way into your heart without you realising .  br    br   a russian janitor  misha vilyenkov  tony shaloub  gets a job in a research laboratory . one day  he hears singing coming from the basement . and when he investigates  he finds a parrot in its cage singing its little heart out . misha becomes fascinated with the bird  especially when it turns out the parrot can not only sing  it can talk . and not a few phrases either . its a parrot you can actually make conversation with .  br    br   the parrot is called paulie  voiced by jay mohr   and recognises a fellow castaway in misha . wondering how this world to the wise bird ended up in a dusty basement  misha convinces paulie to tell him his life story . which all began when he was a baby  and in the care of marie  a five year old girl with a stutter . the two of them became birds of a feather  ok  bad pun   .  br    br   when marie  s parents became concerned about her close friendship with a bird  they considered sending him away . and they finally did after marie nearly injured herself in a fall after teaching paulie to fly . desperate to be reunited with her  paulie begins a long journey across america  which includes a diverse number of new owners  flying great distances  and even ending up behind bars . of a cage that is   br    br   paulie was one of a number of talking animal films released by dreamworks in the late   s . and although it wasn  t afforded the same recognition or box  office success of babe  paulie succeeds on quite a few levels  and is an occasional work of striking intelligence .  br    br   jay mohr  s stand  up style of acting is well suited to the part of paulie . he never plays the part as too smug  even if he is a bit of a smart aleck . paulie  s worldly  but he is also naive in his way .  br    br   because he  s lived a rather sheltered life with marie  when he  s taken away  he has to fend for himself for the first time . and when he falls into the hands of different owners  they make promises to paulie to reunite him with marie  which he believes . only for those promises to be broken time and again .  br    br   paulie is admittedly a little episodic . it follows the eclectic people paulie ends up with  and how he slowly gets brought closer and closer to marie . he first winds up in a pawn shop  where he is adopted by ivy  gena rowlands   a kindly woman who teaches him the meaning of manners . she sympathises with paulie  s situation  and drives an rv across america to find marie .  br    br   paulie is an occasionally very touching film . his scenes with ivy are some of the best . wonderful moments of paulie perched on her shoulder singing tom jones numbers . the way she instills in him the need for hope is great  and some of the dialogue is quite well written and even thought  provoking  br    br    there are things in life you put off  because you think you  re gonna do them later . but the real thing ivy taught me is you gotta live like there may not be a later .   br    br   the scene where ivy passes away en route leaving paulie all alone is a very heart  rending moment . and the sequence where he plucks up the courage to fly for the first time across the grand canyon  soaring majestically is such a beautifully composed scene it stays with you for hours after the film  s over .  br    br   despite the occasional sad moment  there are plenty of laughs to be had . paulie falls in with a group of performing parrots at a spanish outdoor restaurant . the animatronic effects here are really excellent as four birds do a perfectly choreographed dance number . and paulie even gets to have a romance . which is dashed when he falls in with a petty thief  played by mohr as well  . that may be the only complaint i have . as soon as you get comfortable with one situation  the film then moves paulie on to another .  br    br   the scene where paulie is taught to steal money from atm machines is funny  but a little disturbing too . i  m amazed dreamworks were granted the chance to include such a scene in a kids film . and paulie  s diamond robbery is very mission impossible . he  s caught in the act  and shipped off to the lab for animal testing  where he  s remained ever since .  br    br   the story finally comes full circle at the lab  where misha vows to help paulie . of course they do find marie . but the final revelation is a scene of such shocking intensity  i was left numb for several minutes . paulie may never get the longevity babe has  but i believe its an equally brilliant film . the same laughs . the same flawless effects . and the same surprising intelligence .  br    br   a minor gem .  \n",

one made for adults . takashi miike uses the fantasy genre  particularly  the children  s fantasy genre  as a springboard into the wild territory that is the great yokai war .  br    br   the setup is simple a boy is selected to play the  hero  in this years annual festival  only to discover his role is much more real than he could have imagined . what follows is a hallucinatory  grotesque  whimsical  and often funny journey through the world of japanese folklore  but wait there  s also an evil villain on the lose who wants to destroy the world . however  the villain here  is not a mere demon  it is the demon  spirit of the accumulated resentment of those things which humans  use  and  discard  . usuing a chamber made out of pure liquid hate  resentment  the villain transforms the vibrant colorful yokai spirits into soulless ten foot tall makeshift robots which chainsaw for arms and eyes like burning coals  those whove played the video game  sonic the hedghog  might remember a certain dr . robotnik performing similar procedures to the cute and cuddly  s who sonic had to then  liberate   .  br    br   the hero in this film is actually the least interesting character  essentially playing the straight man  in a world gone suddenly mad . though he does go through the typical heroes trials he more often than not cowers  as do many of the yokia themselves  who seem truly defenseless against the murderous robots  some spirits being umbrellas with eyes  talking walls  or creatures whose soul purpose in life is to count beans . . . of course in this magical world of miike  s yokai war even beans take a magical power when one believes in them .  br    br   in several ways this film subverts the normal conventions of children  s fantasy  as few  if any  of the characters are heroic  their victory being a combination of happenstance  almost arbitrary faith  and a desire to party . the yokai spirits  only rally together and lay siege the villains hideout  after they mistake the end of the world invasion of earth for a great yokai festival  and even then only to dance and party . also the film ends not with the usual celebratory all  s well that ends well fantasy ending  but with a final scene  showing our hero years older  with an adult job  now unable to see the yokai spirits of his youth  who then despondently turn to the villain  who being a spirit can never really die . this ending  with it  s yokai spirit who is the spitting image of pokemon  s pikachu  warns us not just of leaving behind our childhood selves  but of the horrors of over  consumption . the villain is resentment caused when humans no longer have reverence for the world and the objects around them  in japanese folklore nearly every object has some kind of spirit   and so when they are used and discarded as we in consumer societies do without reverence  they become soulless vengeful machines  not unlike those seen in modern video games  suggesting that though our imaginations and myths do not ever really die  but can become deformed .  br    br   this is one of the first scripts miike has contributed to  and i believe it shows  as there  s a tightness conceptually that sometimes gets swept under the rug by his exuberance for visual playfulness . though i  ve focused mostly on the story  since lots of users here seem to write it off   i do want to say that visually it  s a kaleidescope of cgi  stop animation  costume  and live puppetry  that works remarkably well . there  s a dreamlike quality to a lot of the film  and the miyazaki comparisons are warranted  as are the neverending story and labrynth comparisons  though this film is sharper and more adult than either . the yokai are beaten  brutalized  and turned into machines of living hate  who i believe even kill a few humans  a deformed aborted calf with a mans face is born and dies in the films grotesque opening  while a sexual undercurrent  the women with the long neck licking the face of our boy hero  or another characters persistent memory of touching the thigh of a young scantily clad water spirit as a boy  seem to linger a bit too long for most western tastes  especially when considering this is a  children  s film  . however these are slight enough to catch adult attentions while minor enough  not to traumatize any children to bad . grims fairy tales  before revisions  did much worse  far more often .  br    br   all and all this is one of miikes most accessible and engaging ventures yet  with enough visual drama and great performances  the yokai spirits have a humanism and an absurd humor to them  thats laugh out loud funny at times  to appeal to audiences of all ages  and a steady conceptual undercurrent strong enough to draw in an adult audience who have presumably brought their children or else come out of a sense of nostalgia for the long lost fantasy films of their youth . the latter group the film seems to address the most fervently asking that they not just continue passive consumption of the world around them  but show reverence to those spirits within them which seemed so much closer to reality in childhood . another beautiful  funny  and truly original film from a thrilling director who hasn  t come close to his apex . instant classic .  \n",

job he does as well . the problem is that i can  t imagine many parents wanting to subject their children to this movie . the best kids movies are the ones that are scary or have mildly disturbing imagery  neverending story and return to oz spring to mind  but in the case of the great yokai war miike probably takes things a little too far . in fact at the screening i was at the person introducing the movie reiterated to the two families there that it was probably not very suitable .  br    br   the film kicks off with the young hero of the piece introducing himself and explaining about his current family problems . this brief moment of mundanity is sharply broken as a cow gives birth to a calf with the face of a human whom screams that something horrendous is coming before falling dead like the abomination it is  it is quite possible that the sheer hideousness of the creature is some bizarre quato homage  .  br    br   following an incredible introduction for main baddie kato  and his henchwoman agi  a surprisingly attractive chiaki kuriyami   by way of an apocalyptic army raising . the story reverts to normal for a while  but it doesn  t take long before any and all logic goes down the drain and the young boy teams up with a group of miyazaki rejects to take out the evil sorcerer .  br    br   the plot of the movie is fairly basic and surprisingly hackneyed at times  the entire chosen one just seems completely out of place in a movie which so regularly breaks clichs  but is aided by a simple awe inspiring vision of a magical world . this really is a miyazaki movie made into a live action movie  albeit a much seedier and more vicious than usual miyazaki movie .  br    br   the film is simply a joy to look at the designs of the yokai is colourful  and largely practical  while the evil robotic monstrosities while not displaying the best cgi in the world have a practicality and menace to them which gives them far more of a palpable threat than you would imagine .  br    br   the cast is uniformly excellent  they just make their characters seem perfectly natural which is commendable when you consider that most of them are in full body makeup or latex suits . even agi lumbered with a ridiculous beehive comes across as sultry and deadly thanks to surprisingly excellent acting from kuriyami .  br    br   while the film does have many elements which put it firmly into family movie territory cute creatures  junior heroes  a thoroughly evil villain  a sense of mischief and adventure  and a telling lack of violence . there are elements which make you question whether miike should have directed such a movie .  br    br   the robot army is a genuinely terrifying menace everyday items warped into monstrous beasts that look like t     sans skin and with added chainsaws . these beasts rip characters to pieces suck creatures into their blood stained mouths  and abduct children from their homes by swiping them right from under their parent  s nose before indulging in a little patricide .  br    br   the creation of the creature is equally arduous for young minds . the yokai  essentially the heroes  are feed into a giant furnace full of a liquidised form of hate which corrodes the yokai  s flesh and forces their angry souls to possess lumps of metal . if kids thought smouldering anakin was bad wait til they see a man sized hedgehog burning to death in a vat of molten hatred for a minute before being turned into an abomination of a motorcycle . there is also limb severing  in one case a severed hand twitches in front of the camera dripping with blood  a fair amount of sexual energy  agi wears one dress designed specifically for fan service and seems to only have sleeping with kato as motivation  while the princess of the rivers wears next to nothing and gets her thighs groped by the young hero in several scenes   and general humour which will go right over the heads of those that this technicolour wonder was seemingly designed for .  br    br   spoilers an example of this being that the yokai only become interested in the final battle when they think it is a big party . the subsequent battle more of a festival than anything  complete with beer  crowd surfing and moshing . also a scene where agi beats the tar out of a cute furry creature seems designed to appeal to the masses jaded by pokemon overkill .  br    br   end spoilers at the end of the day the great yokai war is easily on of miike  s stronger recent films . while it lacks some of the perverse charm of say gozu or ichi it is just continually pushing the audience down a road of general insanity . in fact this is easily miike  s most deranged movie in that he embraces the sheer magic of the subject so wholeheartedly .  br    br   well worth a watch just for the occasional flash of gogo arse .  \n",

amazed at the length . both animated and horror films share a common ground attention span of the selected audience and that should be at or right around   minutes . anything more  and you  ll lose the bulk of your audience .  br    br   this    minutes  or   minutes past its prime was a huge problem for me . i  d like to say half of this movie could  ve been edited out  but i would be too generous to say that . go ahead and watch it and tell me how many scenes could  ve been edited  even without being a film major .  br    br   regardless of the overstayed visit  the movie was below mediocre . it spent all of its time trying to be this huge mystery on which of the  elite    is killing off the remaining friends . for the most part  they not only over  do it  but they zoom in on a face and pretty much say  it  s this guy  no  it  s this gal   you  ll spend more time with the camera misleading you than actually enjoying the movie . and don  t get me started on the acting .  br    br   okay  that got me started . i had to laugh in the beginning trying to remember if melissa sue anderson played the character that went blind on little house on the prairie  later  research proved my suspicions correct  because all the way through this movie  she genuinely looked blind . strange  as an established actress  she should  ve been the best of the group  but turned out the worst . the rest of the staff  aside from ann  bregman  was pretty damn bad  too  but she  uh  took the cake .  br    br   the movie begins with a group of ten friends  and one  s immediately killed off . barely anyone thinks twice of this  dear  friend  s disappearance  so they continue on their merry way . slowly  then more rapidly  there are revelations about virginia  s  anderson   the main character  past and her psychologist  who  s a tad bit more personal  and on call      apparently  than most shrinks . all the while  more and more deaths occur .  br    br   what  s funny is  just as the first  disappearance   the more  best buds  vanish  the less the rest care . sure  they give a few seconds of air time to say  wow   that person  just wouldn  t run off  etc  but then they  re back to their sexual ways . and speaking of which  it  s probably due to the horrid script  or maybe it was i who was losing interest at minute    but it was really hard to keep up with who liked who of the group as they all seemed to be sexual partners of the next or someone would either be freaked out to the max by another and best friends the next scene . see the creepy guy that kept a mouse  rat in his pocket  literally  and was the most obvious suspect . i  m giving the film too much credit  and time   but how he became part of the  elite    i  ll never know .  br    br   but  i digress  there  s a mystery here . why are these kids targets  why is virginia thinking she  s killed someone  when it was never proved   till the end  that any of them actually has been slaughtered  and why would the trailer and poster claim these killings to be  six of the most bizarre murders you will ever see   hell  even for      most of these had been shown in any of the first two friday the   th films  coincidentally enough  friday the   th part  was released  weeks to the day of happy birthday to me . perhaps  they  re speaking of when they filmed it months prior  but were late to the  well  party .  br    br   when the  secrets  are revealed  trust me  you  ll have to rewind    x to actually get the laughable and incoherent motives  and even then  put the subtitles on to get all the mumbling victim  killer  s words . even if you get the first time  it  s an unbelievably outrageous and hilarious finale . it  s almost worth watching the whole movie again  but as a drinking game .  br    br   this birthday gathering should be avoided . it  s a horrible and illogical first draft script  please  please know it takes multiple rewrites before the cameras role  it contains either way under acting or extreme over acting and it  s     unrealistic on how people react in extraordinary circumstances .  br    br   side note when i was a kid  or say      years old  i loved horror films .  still do  oddly . definite guilty pleasures  but they are getting harder and harder to watch as years pass .  we got our first vcr  and i taped as many horror films off network  or  edited versions  tv . all i remember of happy birthday to me is getting the last   minutes on tape  which scared me to death  and obviously gave away the big mystery on who the killer was . even though i have seen other clips of this movie  i think this is the first full  length viewing i  ve had . thankfully  this awful movie didn  t wound me as a child . i am older now  and i can take this trash . but never again .  br    br   side note   that said  that crazy  happy birthday to me  song played in the end credits  and as a score throughout  still creeps me out tremendously . i guess  this movie  or last few minutes   did have an influence on my childhood . shame on you  melissa sue anderson   \n",

      "Progress:49.7% Speed(reviews/sec):353.8 #Correct:249 #Tested:498 Testing Accuracy:50.0%its taken a few viewings for me to really wrap myself around this one  but for me tears of kali is one of the horror highlights of the    s and as far as independent horror goes a veritable masterpiece . an anthology horror  it takes on the story of the fictional taylor  eriksson group  a cult of sorts based in india whose members set out in search of ultimate self knowledge and healing of the psyche  with unpleasant results that echo down the years . with bookend segments set in india the film is made chiefly of three stories set in germany  illustrating the aftermath of the work of the taylor  eriksson group  with some pretty nasty gore at times . its an interesting set up as these things go  but what sets this film apart is the way the imagery is so carefully set up to develop the films horror . bad things have been unleashed and the general course of the film is a look at how the quest for self knowledge and ultimate therapy brings horror to patients  healers and others and the film is loaded with smart visual clues to the power of the dark forces with which it deals  dark forces unbound by time  place or even personality . good examples of this are found in the first story especially  dealing with a journalist interviewing a lady in a mental hospital . previous to this story we have seen lars eriksson and notably his wonky  lazy   eye  we also see him healing or at least comforting a patient . the lady mental patient of the first story is seen in the same stance as eriksson healing a fellow patient  also as she wraps up the canvases from the art class that she runs among her fellow patients one of their pictures is seen  a face with lazy eye like erikssons . there are also references to folk in minuscule roles  extras and walk ons having extra sensory perceptions of what is going on in the film  showing the badness that has been unleashed spreading and able to almost infect others . there is more to the film philosophically than just evil within  it is a film about death  suffering and possible redemption too all bound in a structure derived from hindu beliefs in a fashion that seems like it might just be exploitation but has more relation to actual beliefs than one might expect  at least from the research that i did on wikipedia  . writer  director andreas marschall definitely deserves some significant credit for his skill in constructing the film . as well as being thoughtful  the film is pretty chilling too  the soundtrack of bharti india and panama john has a great eerie piano jingle and there are a couple of notable performances  michael balaun as a sinister doctor and cora chilcot as a freaky patient especially good . the third story also has a fine turn from veteran mathieu carrire as a faith healer . the biggest problem of the film is that it is not that involving a lot of the time so potential for fear is lost but these and a couple of other performances achieve involvement pretty well . so  the film isn  t quite as gripping as it might be  the acting occasionally off and the pacing too  but mostly i thought it was pretty great  if a shade short of its possible brilliance . well worth a look for adventurous horror fans i think .  \n",

audiences and critics are so numbed and lobotomized by the excrement that hollywood churns out that they  ll praise to the skies even a mediocre film with barely any laughs  that  s the only reason i can think of why this horrible romantic comedy  and i use that term loosely because there  s nothing funny in this film  is getting good reviews .  br    br   i sat through this film stunned that screenwriters lowell ganz and babaloo mandel would even for an instant think their script was funny .  br    br   the brilliant nick hornby usually translates well to film . he adapted  fever pitch  for a british film starring colin firth and ruth gemmell in      peter hedges found hornby  s voice for  about a boy        and when  high fidelity  was americanized for a movie in      writers d . v . devincentis  steve pink  john cusack and scott rosenberg didn  t go wrong because they kept the essence of hornby  s wit and humor . they made one of the best films of that year .  br    br   so why does the american version of  fever pitch  go so painfully awry  the british version wasn  t a masterpiece  but it was charming  funny  unexpected and gave us two characters we could like  respect and understand .  br    br   but ganz and mandel have excised everything funny in hornby  s work . in americanizing the story  they  ve butchered it  removing all that was good and unique about hornby  s work and replacing it with conventional drivel .  br    br   they  ve transformed a funny story into a formulaic romantic comedy  never once veering from the wretched formula . lindsey  drew barrymore  has three girlfriends  each of whom has a distinct function . one  s overweight  the second  s cynical and ambitious  and the third  s a romantic . want to guess how many male friends ben  jimmy fallon  has   br    br   what made  high fidelity  such fun was not only a good leading man and lady  but engaging supporting characters . in this  fever pitch   the six supporting friends do or say nothing especially funny . they  re so insignificant  they  re not even decorative . the only reason they  re in the film is because the formula demands it . poor ione skye winds up as one lindsey  s pals in a thankless role . the lovely skye must have been wishing lloyd dobler would swoop in and take her away . come to think of it  cusack would  ve made an excellent ben . of course  cusack is too smart to attach himself to such an utterly tedious script .  br    br   there isn  t a single  solitary moment in this film that seems original or unforced . every plot turn is predictable  every lame joke telegraphed . ganz and mandel labor for laughs . the first   minutes are so excruciatingly slow  you wonder if these chaps realized they were writing a comedy . you can mark the plot turns in this film by your watch . it  s almost as if ganz and mandel penned this with some screen writing guru  s formula pasted on the wall . when they got to a certain page  they looked up at the formula and said   ok  the guru says this has to happen now .  and  presto   br    br   directors bobby and peter farrelly don  t help the film any . they have no concept how to introduce their story and characters  they hand over the v . o . narration not to the protagonist  but to another guy who sits behind ben at fenway park  . thanks to some extremely clunky writing  we have to watch barrymore and fallon stumble through their unfunny initial meetings .  br    br   barrymore does cute and adorable better than most . she  s as good at it as goldie hawn in her heyday . but even her cuteness can  t save this extraordinarily awful film . she tries hard to wring some energy and humor out of this story . about   minutes into the film  lindsey tells ben   you  re funny .  the only explanation for her remark is that it was in the script . for fallon  s ben never says anything even remotely funny . fallon is neither witty nor funny when he does comedy  he overacts .  br    br   fallon was never any good on  saturday night live .  he was quite possibly the least funny person on that show . remember that lame sketch about a radio dj who did all the voices  the only reason  weekend update  worked occasionally was because fallon  s cohort  tina fey  knows a thing or two about comedy .  br    br   actors who think they  re funny and behave that way rarely  if ever  are actually funny . that  s true of fallon . he thinks he  s hysterically funny when he barely raises a chuckle . his stuttering  unsure  of  himself shtick didn  t work on the small screen it  s lousier on the big screen .  br    br   unfortunately for fallon  his role in this picture also requires a few dramatic moments . if you thought his comedy was bad  wait till you get a load of his dramatic stuff . two scenes in particular  the first in a park  the second in front of ben  s school  are painful to watch . the scenes require an actor with a smidgen of dramatic ability  but fallon has neither the knowledge nor the ability to make them work . his range of emotions doesn  t even run the gamut from a to b .  br    br   ben has no personality or depth . often  he comes across as an oaf . and not a lovable one at that . it boggles the mind what lindsey would find attractive about him . compare fallon  s performance to firth  s in the british version  and you  ll understand how terribly flat  unfunny and forced fallon  s ben is and how wrong he is for this role . watching fallon in  fever pitch  makes one long for the dramatic depth and comedic nuance of ashton kutcher   br    br   just as  high fidelity  did  an americanized  fever pitch  could  ve worked brilliantly . it just needed better writers  more competent directors and  most definitely  a stronger  funnier  smarter leading man . do yourself a huge favor avoid this rotten film rent the     british version and read hornby  s book  instead .  \n",

the mood for something like that . the description said it had something to do with some biblical stuff and time travel but i didn  t expect a fundamentalist christian film   br    br   the movie had decent special effects and an interesting premise that could have gone places and been far more interesting than it ended up being . our hero  who is a bible professor from the     s  eventually travels forward to the     s and finds that modern life is filled with the influences of evil  jesus is nowhere to be found . this wonderful technological feat is accomplished with the assistance of a fellow bible teacher who somehow managed to invent a functional hg  wells  style time machine . the movie starts to lose some credibility at this point  which is unfortunate because this happens very early in the film . earlier  or perhaps immediately later  can  t remember for certain   our hero professor was seen teaching what appeared to be a science class where he claimed that scientific findings could only be considered validated if it could be matched with what the bible says . what should be obvious to anyone is that this is clearly not what the scientific method is about  however it is presented such that the filmmakers appear to prefer the point of view that science is useful only if it supports their claims and otherwise is not useful .  br    br   in any case  that belief is perfectly valid and sensible in the context of the character at the time . so  if we accept that as the fact of life for these bible professors  then obviously the professor who went and invented the time machine isn  t a very strong believer as i don  t think there  s any evidence  and none was offered  for the physics of time travel in the bible . so immediately there  s a problem with mixed messages and credibility there  but never mind . . .  br    br   after the professor is convinced to take the leap into the future  the shock of modern technology was handled quite well in most cases . it was also fun to not have it pinned down to an exact year  as the character is reading the date off a newspaper to himself  a car honks a horn and it scares him into not finishing the date it  s just two thousand and . . . honk  . some of the shock went on a little too long  though . for instance  the car was one of the first things he encountered when he arrived and around two days later he  s invited to a church movie night and takes a ride in a van . he sticks his head out the window like a dog might  is scared by the headlights and the starting engine  etc . that seemed a bit off since he  d been there a few days by this point and the city appeared to be quite busy with traffic . in any case  that  s easy to ignore . the rest of the tech shock was well done  especially his first encounter with the tv which was delayed because he didn  t even realize what it was until he saw a kid watching one and using a remote .  br    br   unfortunately  our hero predictably starts to preach to virtually everyone he meets as if he  s an authority on all life and religion just because he  s from the past and is an elder . eventually he gets himself a brief moment in the spotlight at the church he had been visiting where he proceeds to explain his concept of christianity to them in a long monologue that was supposed to be moving and insightful  but mostly was just more of the same . a couple of husbands in the church begin to get a funny feeling about this guy  go figure  and investigate his name . they eventually conclude that he either is a time traveler or is impersonating this long dead bible professor and decide to find out which it is . the movie frames these guys as non  believer bad guys for being skeptical .  br    br   just before the professor is to head back to his own time  he is confronted by those two men . in an effort to avoid being arrested or hauled away  he eventually breaks into an almost insane  like rant about how jesus is coming soon and that he  s a prophet so they should listen to him . just in time  he  s whisked away and one of the husbands wonders if perhaps this is the rapture he  d heard so much about .  br    br   the irony is that this essentially means the professor became a self  proclaimed  and most likely false  prophet claiming to know that the rapture was near and he was sent by god when truthfully he was sent by his fellow bible professor and did not have any god  given knowledge  that was stated or even hinted at  .  br    br   as i understand it  revelation claims that the time of the end is only for god to know and at the end of the film we see the inventor professor trying  and failing  to send a bible into the future . first      then      etc . as the scene fades out . clearly he  s trying to determine the exact date of the end times  which he shouldn  t be able to know  essentially  the entire premise of the movie cancels itself out because by being so insistent on their religious beliefs and how certain things are for god to know only  it means there couldn  t ever be a time machine in the first place because then mankind could find out something that only god should know  the entire movie  s premise collapses and makes the whole thing basically worthless as it undermines it  s own credibility in the end .  \n",

interested in this project because it was being directed by tony scott and i have become very interested in his work after man on fire had such a profound impact on me . before i start my review  let me first say this . . . it  s wonderful to see that this movie could have been told in a boring and ordinary manner  yet the writers and scott chose a different approach .  br    br   plot  br    br   simply stated  it  s not boring . most hollywood movies give  tried and true  plots that they know will connect with people  often ensuring the audiences acceptance of the film and creating a higher probability of profit . this plot was one of the more interesting ones i had seen in a while . just for reference  i recently watched  the weather man  and  lord of war  and while i will say that these movies are excellent  and i enjoyed them both tremendously  both the plots in these movies are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be told . they don  t take any chances whatsoever  and they are extremely predictable after you  ve watched a fair amount of american films . domino  s plot is both interesting and told in a manner that keeps you thinking   oh man  they  re screwed now  . and i feel that has been lacking in a lot of recent films . it has a lot of depth to it  in my opinion  and gives you plenty of things to question while watching it . overall  this is what kept me so interested in the movie .  br    br   characters  br    br   i felt that the characters were accurate . knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman  who was anything but on the inside and wanted to be viewed as what she was . it was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she took whatever means she had to accomplish that .  br    br   choco was also very believable  his use of spanish in inappropriate situations  his reactions to domino  s lack of affection  as well as his jealousy issues within the team . . . they all rang true to me  which made me feel that his character was that much more realistic .  br    br   rourke  s character was the least interesting to me  but it still rang true to me . he seemed like an ordinary guy  trying to make ends meet . i hope that  s what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because that  s what i got out of it . he did a very good job of showing ed in an average joe kind of way that has made his mistakes  yet is still trying to live .  br    br   claremont  ladies i believe that they provided much needed  heart  to the story . they weren  t just people who are out getting money to buy a bentley  these were real people who had a real problem and they sought others mean to accomplish that goal . you could empathize with them because  to them  this child  s illness was a problem with no other solution . these characters were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate who got into this mess because they needed help .  br    br   the mobsters they made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can . and i really liked that part . they also padded the story with small intricacies that made the plot that much more interesting .  br    br   christopher walken       guys  br    br   they provided the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie . from walken  s awkward statements to the ceaseless references to the      guys being has  beens . their involvement in the movie only made it that much more enjoyable .  br    br   cinematography . . . . yes . . . . the cinematography . this is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans . but in my opinion i thought it was genius  the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion . i considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement  just like anything else . i both applaud and congratulate scott  the editor  the cinematographer and the director of photography on taking some real chances with this movie . not only did they go far and above with its presentation  they went that much further . the use of colors  both extremely light and extremely dark provided the  look  of the film with a sinister and grungy look that accurately depicts the life of the mob  bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a manner that show that their life isn  t as peachy or  clean  as everyone else . if you notice  in times of less stress or conflict  there were very few camera tricks if any at all . this shows that scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and weren  t just doing it for the heck of it . i realize that most people who watched this movie weren  t expecting it and it cause many of them to be turned off to this film but i think it was great that scott took this approach . hollywood films have grown predictable and bland . most of them are shot in the same manner with the same twists and turns . and i  m glad that scott tried to make something different .  br    br   granted  this movie isn  t for everyone  but to say it  s trash and has nothing to offer is completely missing the point . i thoroughly enjoyed this film and i  m glad that i spent the money for it . i would recommend this to all  but i  m sure it will only hit a chord with few . i must agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the  sphere of mtv  won  t appreciate this movie  but i think many people will . we should all try to enjoy it for the fact that scott and co . took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique . and with that in mind  i think he succeeded tremendously .  \n",

fiction        when jules and vincent are talking about mia wallace and what she does for a living . jules tells vincent that the  only thing she did worthwhile was pilot  . vincent asks  what the hell is a pilot   and jules goes into a very well description of what a tv pilot is  well  the way they make shows is  they make one show . that show  s called a  pilot  . then they show that show to the people who make shows  and on the strength of that one show they decide if they  re going to make more shows . some pilots get picked and become television programs . some don  t  become nothing . she starred in one of the ones that became nothing .  now to stretch on what jules was talking about  there are billions of television shows  pilots that were never aired because they simply were not . . . well  good . probably the most notorious pilot that comes to mind is  walter   a spin  off to  mash  with gary  radar  burghoff as the lead . hmmm  would somebody really want to be watching radar for a half  hour trying to solve crimes  hence  the show was never picked up . what many people don  t know  or what they thought they knew  is that pilots are hardly ever shown on the air  for they are made strictly for the television networks for them to decide . some have made they  re way past and got onto the air  the pilot for the animated series  american dad  comes to mind  as the show  s serial itself didn  t begin until nearly four months later . however  there are times were we should all be glad pilots never make it to air  and this here is why .  br    br    black bart   a supposed tie  in with the mel brooks comedy classic   blazing saddles   is a stale and bland  sitcom  with little heart and no soul .  saddles  was a controversial comedy  nevertheless  with it  s racist humor and vulgar comedy  which comes to mind  what idiot decided this would make a great television show for prime time tv     i say  supposed   because none of the memorable characters from the movie  aside from bart  on in this mess of a tv show . mel brooks wasn  t even involved with the production of the serial and this was the first mistake in a long line  in a related story  i recently found out about an unaired tv pilot for a series based on the movie  clerks .  that kevin smith was no involved in . . . . you see what happens     .  br    br   set somewhere around the same time as the movie  or at all   the story circles around the only black sheriff in the wild west  named appropriately  black  bart  who is this time played by future academy award winner louis gossett jr .  obviously before his stint in  real  acting  whereas in this he is playing a  g  rated  richard pryor . most of the other characters are carbon  if not  really bad  copies of the characters in the movie jim  the waco kid is replaced by a similar looking character named reb jordan  a former confederate soldier who is quick with the gun . lilian von schtupp is now belle buzzer  a more of a ripoff of the character being that she  s a show dancer and a german with a marlene dietrich  type accent and personality . while that  s pretty much the end in similarities  the lead  bad guy  in the story is fern malaga  played by noble willingham  who i assumed would  ve been hedley lamar if warner bros . secured the rights to the name  see trivia for  blazing saddles   and his son curley . . . i dunno  taggart i suppose  the story is a poor excuse for a sitcom  much less a pilot . bart deals with the mayor  s drunk son and he  s out  of  control behavior which has caused the town to spin . really  it  s a story that tries to introduce all the characters in the  series  and doesn  t focus on the variety and context that would make this an  alright  show . i can  t really call it a sitcom  and even if i wanted to  and that  s primarily the fact it was shot on the backlot at warner bros . studios and later added a laugh track  so the show is set up almost exactly like  mash   complete with a bland and dull  laughing  that is identical to the series  . the acting is so  so  but there  s one part that always make me laugh  and that  s when the actor playing reb jordan almost seems to forget his lines and tries really hard to remember them while trying to sputter out a piece of dialogue . ha  the script is rather dull and is attempts to make racism more humorous than it was in the movie  surprisingly  they use the word  ner  numerous amount of times through a    minute episode  rather touchy for it  s time period and even for today  and it gets repetitive .  br    br   if you ever get your hands on this unseen piece of sssss . . . surly interesting novelty item  watch it just for the sake of the feeling for watching pilots  it  s on the collector  s edition of  blazing

warned  if you haven  t seen the movie yet . this are just my thoughts  why i think the movie fails  in the end  pun intended  .  br    br   acting wise  rosario dawson is really good and almost conveys portraying someone almost a decade younger  a teenager in other words  . the villain guy is good  but loses his  evil  touch right before the end . if he really never changes  then why would he let a woman tie him up  he wouldn  t  period . then we also have the bartender   nd rape dude . actually i don  t think you would need him . at least not for the  nd rape  but more about that later on .  br    br   let  s reprise the story . rosarios character is sexually insecure  might even have lesbian tendencies  see her scene with a female friend  . this wasn  t intentional  as rosario states herself  but there is sexual tension between them . rosario  s character meets a guy  who is a sexual predator  in all the bad senses . but he makes an impression on her .  br    br   rosario commented that her character had a boyfriend before . i beg to differ . because she acts  as if it is her first boyfriend  which also underlines her phone conversation with her mother . talking about her mother  here  s another problem . after the first rape takes place  rosarios character doesn  t tell anyone what happened . seiing that her relationship with her mother is a very close one  nothing of that gets explored after that . if rosarios character wouldn  t call her mother anymore or would behave strangely  the mother would be worried like crazy . there was so much potential here . also her female friend we see her at the party  it  s obvious there is something going on and  boom  she is gone .  br    br   the first rape is almost unbearable to watch . but feels like a pinch  when you compare it to the ending  rape   which feels like you  re getting hit with a sledge hammer  after rape no .  we get too stretched out scenes . threads are opened  such as her construction work is an indication that she might be lesbian  as one guy states who tried to hit on her . . .   but left in the open . no real social contact is established  if you leave the bartender guy out  who is involved in the  nd and last rape scene . it  s apparent that he isn  t a  nice  guy and his character get  s fleshed out a bit . but when rosarios character meets her rapist in class again  his being in the movie seems pointless . we get the point that rosarios character isn  t the same anymore  that she went  bad  and is able to hurt people .  too  many scenes show exactly that  her being without emotion just doing drugs and other stuff . back to rapist   who cheats on a test  gets caught by rosarios character and they decide to hang out together again  really   . as absurd as that sounds  the guy meets up with her  not without us having seen him beforehand  with another girl  very likely that he raped her too  although we never see anything of that  fortunately  and his football career . well career is a stretch and he is bullied . this is an attempt to give his character some depth and it almost works  but then again is too clich to stay with you . so rapist   submits to rosarios character . . . why exactly  because he promised her  it was her day  again  really  a guy like that never loses control  especially with a woman he raped before . . . i guess this is supposed to show us how stupid he is . the bartender guy would have worked as someone who could have hit him over the head or something  but letting him submit like that  just feels wrong . another possibility would have a drug in his drink .  br    br   so rapist   undresses and get  s blindfolded and let  s rosarios character tie him on a bed . . . . seriously  that  s just crazy  but what comes next  is even crazier . first she talks to him  then she  shuts  him up and forces an object into him . this is as difficult to watch as rape scene number one . this isn  t about what this guy deserves or not  it  s just intense . and of course that was what they were aiming for . now after she is  done  the bartender guy comes in and rapes . . . rapist   . if this really should work as a revenge movie  it would have been better if rosarios character herself would have been doing all the  revenge  . having a henchman doing the job  takes away everything that was built up .  br    br   this isn  t supposed to be entertaining  enjoyable  it  s a hard watch  it is art  house . but the   minute  i didn  t count  rape scene at the end  just smashes everything . rosarios character is more or less  only watching what happens . which brings me to the biggest disappointment .  br    br   irreversible comparison  irreversible  had the rape scene  but the movie went on  even if it was back into time  . rosario is looking into the camera in the end and says something about having to get over this . first  that comes a bit too late  that should see her say that after the initial rape . and secondly and most importantly  this is where the art  house movie should  ve come in . it is more interesting seeing were rosarios character would go after the second rape scene and how she would cope  with what she had done . but then again  she didn  t actually physically do that much  see above  . . . a broken character that the movie cuts off . . .  br    br   good intentions  talia and rosario had worked before   but failing to convey most of the things  they set out to do  even if you can see what they meant  it has to be convincing  otherwise it doesn  t work  . . . not to mention the overlong rape scenes as they are . . .  \n",

they made was giving this guy a microphone  because he was screaming half the time despite us sitting no more than  or  feet away from him . now  his speech was full of the usual  if you fail to prepare  then prepare to fail  stuff  but there were various instances where i got really worked up . the guy stood there in front of us preaching how throughout his life he did everything for himself and no  one else . he was offered many deals in the past to give up kick  boxing  but he never took his eye off the prize of becoming australia  s greatest kick  boxer . he said that he wasn  t a sell  out  he was happy and a retiree  he wasn  t ever involved in any other activity other than kickboxing then he plugged his film . yes  you heard right  he plugged his new film . as he talked about it  he got a woman to come in and hold up a poster advertising it  and then he showed this shitty  minute clip of this vile film called  trojan warrior  .  this all being before he was defeated by gurkan ozkan in his final career fight  for now    br    br   stan plays ajax  a kick  boxing ex  special forces agent that is pulled into the seedy underworld of melbourne . ajax  s cousin  theo  arthur

sorts of ridiculous situations  from fighting in a kebab shop to posing as playboys at a bondage party . it  s all pretty ridiculous  but if silverstein was actually aiming to make a credible film here  this man should never be handed a camera again .  br    br   i  ll admit  i was actually pumped to see this . i love action films  even if they  re corny  and especially if it  s set in my own backyard . but what i was introduced to was a film with acting that was appalling from the word  go   and continued to do so after the words  for the love of god please make it stop    subplots were introduced and not even touched on again after they were out in the open  characters were just thrown in for absolutely no reason whatsoever  and the most over  choreographed fight scenes that didn  t even remotely reflect stan  s actual talent in kickboxing . the cast consisted of useless cameo appearances by just about anyone remotely famous  dermot brereton  mark  chopper  read and greg matthews  . the whole time you  re sitting there and playing the guessing game of just who is standing there in the background . too bad the movie relies heavily on split  second appearances by former celebrities . remember those plot  holes i told you about  ajax once upon a time was apparently locked up  wrongly accused for murdering his wife . now  we hear that ajax was in special forces via one single sentence in the whole film  and then leave it for buggery . this is followed by another single sentence which persuades ajax to help the same people who wrongly locked him up . then  get this  at the end  it is revealed to ajax that his wife isn  t actually dead  but was sold into prostitution . do we see her  no . does ajax go off to find her as soon as he hears this  no . now that  s a marriage   br    br   amidst all this irritatingly puerile crap  some website described this film as  a cross between jackie chan  guy ritchie  . has this man ever sat down and watched a jackie chan film   chan shows more dexterity taking a dump than stan did doing  well  anything  and guy ritchie is the crime  film messiah  and you  re comparing him to salik silverstein   this film is more like a mix between  pizza  and  enter the ninja  .  br    br   now  where do you thing the whole  trojan warrior  title comes from  ajax  s fierce fighting skills like that of an ancient greek warrior  no . the gangsters  unification to find theo  like that of the trojan empire  no . it  s because wait for it theo carries a condom around with him . yes  that right  because theo is always prepared with a trojan brand rubber in his pocket  he is a trojan warrior   br    br   i had the displeasure of seeing  trojan warrior  on dvd  as well as it  s  special  features  br    br    video clip of  chop chop   a rap song by mark  chopper  read chopper did this for the sole purpose of proving that anyone can rap . the funny thing was chopper just rapped for   seconds and then threw it over to these two albino teens from doncaster  using such words as  dis  and  dope  etc in their australian accents . face it people  rap was developed in the states  leave it there  the clip looked like something

say this film contributes to the reason this country is going to hell when it comes to film  but . . . oh wait  i just did . my advice to anyone reading this is for you to go out and buy  or  copies
